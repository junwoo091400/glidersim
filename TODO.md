 * Precompute: y, Gamma, theta, fc, fx, fy, fz, more?


 * Call the `Cl` directly, don't just assign a function pointer

 * Move BrakeGeometry from Glider into Wing

 * Add `delta` to the coefficients function calls, or elsewhere it's needed

 * Call the brake to get the `delta` for each section




 * change the `alpha_i`, `wi` etc to just `alpha`, `w`, etc?
