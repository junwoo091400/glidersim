Limitations
===========

* The paraglider line geometry assumes the total line length (for the line
  drag) is constant. Technically the lines get shorter when the accelerator is
  applied, but my model assumes the effect of that segment is negligible.

* My dynamics models do not conserve momentum. Weight shifting, the
  accelerator, air density, etc: the momentum should be changing with respect
  to those.
